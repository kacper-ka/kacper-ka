### About me
My name is Kacper and I am an embedded systems engineer.

I busy myself with hardware design and embedded software development (duh!).

### Professional career
Currently I am emplyed by *Fluence Technology*, a Warsaw-based company where we research, design and manufacture femtosecond lasers.

I am responsible for some of the hardware design and most of the firmware development. Additionally I am involved in some *DevOps* and general infrastructure maintenance.

### Spare time
Not much of that but those few moments are taken by additional education in the field of electronics and reliable software development.

*More to come some day in the future...*
